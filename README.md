Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently studying Malware Analysis courses.
💻 I have good experience Reverse Engineering Software & Malware, and spend a lot of time writing C++ programs to read/write memory in common software.
🌱 I’m documenting all my progress, course notes, and malware writeups on my github blog: https://1504681.github.io/
