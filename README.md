Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently studying Malware Analysis courses.

ğŸ’» I have good experience Reverse Engineering Software & Malware, and spend a lot of time writing C++ programs to read/write memory in common software.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m documenting all my progress, course notes, and malware writeups on my github blog: https://1504681.github.io/
